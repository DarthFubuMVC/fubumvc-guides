The documentation has been graciously donated by members of our online community.

If you are thinking about a new guide or major changes to the organization of the existing guides, please be courteous and do this in your own fork so it can be dicussed before merging. 
                                                   
The guides are written in [Textile]() and there is information on the [fubumvc-guides wiki](http://wiki.github.com/railsdog/fubumvc-guides) on the general style to use when writing a guide.  Please stick to the established format and feel free to ask questions on [fubumvc-user](http://groups.google.com/group/fubumvc-user) or #fubumvc if you have any questions. 

To build the entire set of guides simply run the following command

<pre><code>
  $ git clone git://github.com/railsdog/fubumvc-guides.git
  $ cd fubumvc guides
  $ rake guides
</code></pre>
            
You will also need to install the RedCloth gem (4.1.1 or greater) if you do not done so.  Output will be generated in the `output` directory.

Just send an email to [fubumvc-user](http://groups.google.com/group/fubumvc-user) (be sure to include your github username) and say that you would like to contribute.  We'll add you to the list so you can commit directly to the guides project.
