<h3 id="introductionto-fubu-mvc">2 Introduction to FubuMVC</h3>
<h4 id="whatis-fubu-mvc">2.1 What is FubuMVC?</h4>
<p>FubuMVC is a <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/frontController.html">Front Controller-style</a> <span class="caps">MVC</span> framework for .Net written in the C# language.  FubuMVC was started by a team of developers who wanted to stay on the .Net platform but were unhappy with the shape and direction of <span class="caps">ASP</span>.Net <span class="caps">MVC</span>.  The goals and architectural philosophy of FubuMVC is:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Exploit the idea of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd419655.aspx">convention over configuration</a> for better productivity, but allow users to teach FubuMVC about their own conventions against a well-defined semantic model.</li>
	<li>Decouple your application code from framework code and keep your application relatively free from the scourges of Xml configuration, inheritance tangles, and attribute soup.</li>
	<li>Remove friction from automated testing of your application code</li>
	<li>Maximize the ability to use composition throughout your application by focusing on <span class="caps">SOLID</span> principles, separation of concerns, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don&#39;t_repeat_yourself"><span class="caps">DRY</span></a>.  Internally, FubuMVC uses your application&#8217;s Inversion of Control container to build out its own dependencies.</li>
	<li>Modular architectures.  FubuMVC includes the most sophisticated and capable infrastructure for modularizing and extending web applications in the .Net ecosystem.</li>
	<li>Provide a less painful development experience with informative diagnostics about your application</li>
	<li>Use static typing in an advantageous way.  Many other alternative web frameworks in the .Net space are faithful copies of Ruby or Python frameworks that have neither the strengths of Ruby/Python or C#.  FubuMVC uses the rich metadata from static typing to drive conventions and reduce errors.  If you prefer Ruby on Rails or Sinatra style development, we think you should use Ruby on Rails or Sinatra instead of attempting to work that way inside of C#.</li>
	<li>Eliminate the dreaded &#8220;tag soup&#8221; problem in views by using advanced html helpers and conventions to <span class="caps">DRY</span> up your views</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="whatdo-ineedtoknowbefore-igetstarted">2.2 What do I need to know before I get started?</h4>
<p>FubuMVC is open source. That means it&#8217;s developed, for free, by dedicated individuals without a lot of free time (we have families and day jobs). While we try to provide a nice, polished experience for developer, it can&#8217;t always succeed in that objective.  FubuMVC is licensed under the permissive &#8220;Apache 2.0&#8221; license:https://github.com/DarthFubuMVC/fubumvc/raw/master/license.txt.  Contributions are most certainly welcome, just fork the <a href="https://github.com/DarthFubuMVC/fubumvc">git repository</a> and start firing off pull requests.</p>
<p>As of May 2011, FubuMVC is powering production websites at 5-6 companies with more in development.  While we know that FubuMVC will never attain the usage of the official Microsoft offerings, we would like to have more users just to make the ecosystem richer and more viable for the long run.</p>
<div class='info'><p>FubuMVC will be rougher and more raw than something you might get from Microsoft or a 3rd party library vendor. Please bear with us as we improve and make FubuMVC better. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome. Your assistance and time are welcome more, though :)</p></div>

<h3 id="core-architecture">3 Core Architecture</h3>
<p>FubuMVC takes a slightly different approach to the classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_2">Model 2 Model View Controller pattern</a> that puts more focus on composing a pipeline of what we call &#8220;behaviors&#8221; that are completely unaware of each other rather than the traditional Model-View-Controller triad.</p>
<p>A typical web request for a view will look something like:</p>
<ol>
	<li>An http request is received by the web server.  The <span class="caps">ASP</span>.Net routing module acts as a front controller to choose a &#8220;chain&#8221; of behaviors to execute</li>
	<li>The first behavior calls an &#8220;action&#8221; (think Controller) that interacts with the rest of your application and returns a view model representing the data to be rendered by the view</li>
	<li>A second behavior invokes a WebForms or Spark view to render the view model that was returned from the action in the previous step</li>
</ol>
<p>As far as a developer is concerned, all the familiar elements of classic <span class="caps">MVC</span> are present, but there&#8217;s nothing to stop you from composing a different pipeline of behaviors for more sophisticated request handling.</p>
<h4 id="view-models">3.1 View Models</h4>
<p>View models are typically <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object">Data Transfer Objects</a> that are either inputs to or outputs from behaviors.  It&#8217;s probably advantageous to think of view models as messages passed to or between behaviors.  As a baked in &#8220;opinion,&#8221; FubuMVC strongly prefers that the input models are unique across actions in your application.  FubuMVC can use an input model to resolve Url&#8217;s or authorization rules in the system.  Likewise, output model signatures from action methods are used to &#8220;attach&#8221; view and other output behaviors to a behavior chain.</p>
<h4 id="actions-controllers">3.2 Actions (Controllers)</h4>
<p>In classic <span class="caps">MVC</span> the controllers have the responsibility of processing the http input and deciding what data was to be displayed by the view layer.  In FubuMVC this responsibility is performed by what we simply call &#8220;actions.&#8221;  Actions in FubuMVC are just methods on concrete <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_CLR_Object"><span class="caps">POCO</span></a> classes in your application that will be called during an Http request like the following:</p>
<div class='code_container'><code class='html'>
    public class HomeController
    {
        public HomeViewModel Home(HomeInputModel inputModel)
        {
            return new HomeViewModel();
        }
    }

    public class HomeInputModel
    {
    }

    public class HomeViewModel
    {
    }


</code></div><p>Typically, you will let FubuMVC marshal the raw Http data into an input model, then FubuMVC will call your action method directly and store any output where later behaviors can find it.  This is what we call the &#8220;one model in, one model out&#8221; philosophy, meaning that actions should typically only be concerned with your application&#8217;s data and services rather than exercising framework machinery.</p>
<p>One of the original goals of FubuMVC was to simplify our controller actions so that all they had to do was process a request object and return a response with no coupling to giant base classes or repetitive boilerplate code just to feed the framework.  We believe that the &#8220;one model in, one model out&#8221; opinion makes our code easier to read, write, and test by removing the noise code so prevalent in other .Net solutions.  It also greatly improves our ability to compose the runtime pipeline and creates traceability between parts of the application.</p>
<h4 id="views">3.3 Views</h4>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve got view models and actions to process them, you need something to render the view model into html.  As of this writing, FubuMVC supports the Web Forms and Spark view engines.  In addition, you can happily have actions spit out raw html or <a href="https://github.com/DarthFubuMVC/htmltags">HtmlTag/HtmlDocument</a> objects.</p>
<h4 id="behaviorsand-behavior-chains">3.4 Behaviors and Behavior Chains</h4>
<p>During day to day development most developers are going to be working strictly with view models, actions, and views.  Internally, the FubuMVC framework sees all these things as a chain of &#8220;behavior&#8221; objects nested within each other in what we frequently refer to as the <a href="http://codebetter.com/jeremymiller/2011/01/09/fubumvcs-internal-runtime-the-russian-doll-model-and-how-it-compares-to-asp-net-mvc-and-openrasta/">Russian Doll Model</a>.</p>
<p>Even a simple Http request is likely to be handled by multiple behaviors.  While FubuMVC comes out of the box with behaviors for common tasks like Json serialization/deserialization, calling actions, and rendering views, you can build your own custom behaviors.</p>
<h4 id="wrappers">3.5 Wrappers</h4>
<p>Wrappers are simply behaviors that you can use to perform additional work during an Http request like authorization checks, caching, activity tracking, or just extra auditing.</p>
<h4 id="behavior-graphand-fubu-registry">3.6 BehaviorGraph and FubuRegistry</h4>
<p>FubuMVC contains a configuration model called BehaviorGraph that completely models how each possible Http endpoint will be handled.  For each Http endpoint in the system, BehaviorGraph models:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Routes and Url&#8217;s</li>
	<li>Behavior Chains</li>
	<li>Actions to be called</li>
	<li>Views or other output behaviors like Json output that will be called</li>
	<li>Authorization rules</li>
	<li>Wrappers</li>
</ol>
<p>You won&#8217;t work directly with these objects daily, but understanding the underlying BehaviorGraph model is crucial to writing your own FubuMVC conventions and policies later.</p>
<h4 id="inversionof-control-container">3.7 Inversion of Control Container</h4>
<p>FubuMVC is built around the idea of composition, but that composition can come at a cost.  FubuMVC uses your application&#8217;s IoC container to assemble all the various pieces, services, behaviors, and extensions that make up a functioning FubuMVC application.  We like to say that FubuMVC is &#8220;Dependency Injection turtles all the way down,&#8221; meaning that <strong>all</strong> FubuMVC services are resolved from the IoC container without hacks like &#8220;IDependencyResolver.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this writing (May 2011), FubuMVC only supports the StructureMap container, but work is ongoing to add Castle Windsor support for a following release.</p>
<h4 id="bottles">3.8 Bottles</h4>
<p>FubuMVC uses the <a href="https://github.com/DarthFubuMVC/bottles">Bottles project</a> for modularity.  Bottles can be used to break your application up into different &#8220;areas&#8221; or to extend your application with new content or abilities.</p>
<h4 id="webconfigdependencies">3.9 Web.config dependencies</h4>
<p>I wish it wasn&#8217;t so, but for now FubuMVC has some required dependencies that must be configured via Xml in web.config:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The System.Web.Routing.UrlRoutingModule module must be registered</li>
	<li>Access to the folder &#8220;Content&#8221; should be authorized for all users (this is where FubuMVC assumes that content like images, scripts, and styles are stored)</li>
	<li>Access to the folder &#8220;_content&#8221; should be authorized for all users (this is where FubuMVC assumes that content like images, scripts, and styles are stored for packages.  This will be changed in the near term)</li>
	<li>Access to the folder &#8220;fubu-content&#8221; should be denied for all users.  This folder is related to the Bottles support in FubuMVC</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="hello-fubu-mvc">4 Hello, FubuMVC!</h3>
<p>Let&#8217;s do the inevitable &#8220;Hello, World!&#8221; exercise in FubuMVC.</p>
<h4 id="setupanew-fubu-mv-capplication">4.1 Setup a new FubuMVC application</h4>
<p>Open Visual Studio.Net and create a new &#8220;Empty <span class="caps">ASP</span>.Net Web Application&#8221; called &#8220;QuickStart.&#8221;  Assuming that you have <a href="http://nuget.codeplex.com/">Nuget</a> installed on your box, query for and select the FubuMVC Nuget:</p>
<p><img src="images/getting_started/SelectNuget.png" title="Installing FubuMVC via Nuget" alt="Installing FubuMVC via Nuget" /></p>
<p>In Solution Explorer, your project layout should look like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/getting_started/ProjectLayout1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Adding the Nuget reference adds a few pieces to your application:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Some directives to the web.config file</li>
	<li>A basic FubuRegistry class called &#8220;ConfigureFubuMVC&#8221; that registers some basic conventions for your application</li>
	<li>Using the WebActivator library, adds a call in the application start event to the FubuApplication class to bootstrap the FubuMVC model, Route&#8217;s, and your IoC container</li>
	<li>The FubuMVC.GettingStarted package in /fubu-content (you&#8217;ll remove this later)</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="fireupyourbrowser">4.2 Fire up your browser!</h4>
<p>Now, just for fun, let&#8217;s fire up the application and see what happens.  Make sure your new QuickStart project is the startup project for your solution and press F5 to start debugging.  Your browser should open to this page:</p>
<p><img src="images/getting_started/GettingStartedPage.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry about where that content came from, we&#8217;ll get to that later &#8212; and how to get rid of it too.  Before we get into the details of just what it is that Nuget dumped into your application, let&#8217;s do the obligatory &#8220;Hello, world!&#8221; exercise.</p>
<h4 id="say-hello">4.3 Say &#8220;Hello!&#8221;</h4>
<p>Alright, assuming that we&#8217;ve got a working application, let&#8217;s add our first endpoint to the system.  Add a class to your project like this to your project:</p>
<div class='code_container'><code class='html'>
namespace QuickStart
{
    public class HelloWorldController
    {
        public string HelloWorld()
        {
            return &quot;Hello world!&quot;;
        }
    }
}


</code></div><p>Compile and restart the web application to bring up the home page again, but this time, go to the url for ~/helloworld.  You should see this:</p>
<p><img src="images/getting_started/HelloWorld.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Pretty cool, right?  You managed to spit out a string to the browser window.  Let&#8217;s try it again, but this time, let&#8217;s make &#8220;Hello world!&#8221; render as html:</p>
<div class='code_container'><code class='html'>
namespace QuickStart
{
    public class HelloWorldInHtmlController
    {
        public string HelloWorld2Html()
        {
            return &quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Hello world!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;;
        }
    }
}

</code></div><p>Compile and open your browser to ~/helloworld2:</p>
<p><img src="images/getting_started/HelloWorld2.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>One last time, but this time let&#8217;s add a title to the page and turn the text blue.  This is the point where I don&#8217;t care to use raw strings, so we&#8217;re going to switch to using the HtmlTags library.  Add this class to your project and compile:</p>
<div class='code_container'><code class='html'>
namespace QuickStart
{
    using HtmlTags;

    public class HelloWorldWithHtmlTagsController
    {
        public HtmlDocument BlueHello()
        {
            var document = new HtmlDocument
            {
                Title = &quot;Saying hello to you&quot;
            };

            document
                .Add(&quot;h1&quot;)
                .Text(&quot;Hello world!&quot;)
                .Style(&quot;color&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;);

            return document;
        }
    }
}

</code></div><p>Compile and open your browser to ~/bluehello:</p>
<p><img src="images/getting_started/BlueHello.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4 id="saymyname">4.4 Say my name!</h4>
<p>Just to be slightly more challenging, let&#8217;s create an endpoint that can display your name with the Url pattern &#8220;~/my/name/is/{Name}.&#8221;  Using FubuMVC&#8217;s nomenclature for url patterns, &#8220;{Name}&#8221; would be a <tt>RouteInput</tt> that you would have to be supplied as part of the Url.</p>
<p>To implement this endpoint, enter this code and compile:</p>
<div class='code_container'><code class='html'>
namespace QuickStart
{
    using HtmlTags;

    public class SayMyNameController
    {
        public HtmlDocument get_my_name_is_Name(NameModel input)
        {
            var document = new HtmlDocument();
            document.Title = &quot;What's your name?&quot;;
            document.Add(&quot;h1&quot;).Text(&quot;My name is &quot; + input.Name);
            return document;
        }
    }

    public class NameModel
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }
    }
}

</code></div><p>Since <strong>my</strong> name is Jeremy, I&#8217;m going to enter the Url &#8220;~/my/name/is/Jeremy&#8221; into the browser to get to this page:</p>
<p><img src="images/getting_started/MyNameIs.png" alt="" /></p>
<h4 id="howdidthatstuffgetthere">4.5 How did that stuff get there?</h4>
<p>Open your browser to the main diagnostics page at ~/_fubu (or click the link &#8220;Diagnostics for your application&#8221; from the home page for the application):</p>
<p><img src="images/getting_started/Diagnostics.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Get used to the diagnostics pages (~/_fubu) because you&#8217;re going to spend a lot of quality time with them as you&#8217;re learning FubuMVC.  From here, click onto the link for &#8220;Behavior chains&#8221; and look carefully at the bottom four rows in the table and see what we&#8217;ve got.:</p>
<p><img src="images/getting_started/DiagnosticsChains1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>At no point in the &#8220;Hello, world&#8221; exercise did we explicitly:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Register the *Controller classes with FubuMVC</li>
	<li>Inherit from any kind of magic base class</li>
	<li>&#8220;Tell&#8221; FubuMVC to render a string to the output</li>
	<li>&#8220;Tell&#8221; FubuMVC to render the output of the HelloWorld2Html() method with the mimetype &#8220;text/html&#8221;</li>
	<li>Define a route for the get_my_name_is_Name(NameModel input) method with the pattern &#8220;my/name/is/{Name}&#8221; that only responds to the Http &#8220;<span class="caps">GET</span>&#8221; method.</li>
</ol>
<p>FubuMVC uses conventions very heavily to figure out what it should do.  The FubuRegistry class dropped in by Nuget registers a few basic conventions to get you started:</p>
<div class='code_container'><code class='html'>
using FubuMVC.Core;

namespace QuickStart
{
    public class ConfigureFubuMVC : FubuRegistry
    {
        public ConfigureFubuMVC()
        {
            // This line turns on the basic diagnostics and request tracing
            IncludeDiagnostics(true);

            // All public methods from concrete classes ending in &quot;Controller&quot;
            // in this assembly are assumed to be action methods
            Actions.IncludeClassesSuffixedWithController();

            // Policies
            Routes
                .IgnoreControllerNamesEntirely()
                .IgnoreMethodSuffix(&quot;Html&quot;)
                .RootAtAssemblyNamespace();

            // Match views to action methods by matching
            // on model type, view name, and namespace
            Views.TryToAttachWithDefaultConventions();
        }
    }
}
</code></div><p>In the code above, there&#8217;s a convention registered to add all the public methods in the classes in the QuickStart assembly named [Something]Controller as actions.  There&#8217;s another set of conventional rules about how to determine a route based on an action&#8217;s signature.</p>
<p>Out of the box, FubuMVC has a few simple conventions baked in, and you can see some of them in play in our &#8220;Hello, world!&#8221; exercise:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If an action returns a string, write that string to the output</li>
	<li>If an action method returns a string <strong>and</strong> its name ends in &#8216;Html,&#8217; write out the string returned with the mime type &#8216;text/html&#8217; and remove the &#8216;Html&#8217; from the conventionally determined route pattern.</li>
	<li>If an action method contains underscores, treat the underscores as slashes in the generated route pattern.  If the action method name starts with the name of an Http method like &#8220;get&#8221; or &#8220;post,&#8221; add a constraint to the Route</li>
</ul>
<div class='note'><p>This guide is concentrating on using conventions to configure the application, but it&#8217;s perfectly possible to use the normal litany of Fluent API&#8217;s and/or .Net Attributes to override the conventions</p></div>
<h3 id="whatsnext">5 What&#8217;s next?</h3>
<p>In this guide you&#8217;ve seen how to :</p>
<ul>
	<li>Set up your first FubuMVC application</li>
	<li>Add an action, models, and a view</li>
	<li>Launch the app, view the diagnostics, and the output of your action</li>
</ul>
<p>Since this is a getting started guide, there&#8217;s a lot we did <em>not</em> cover. This getting started app isn&#8217;t very useful right now.</p>
<p>Next, you&#8217;ll probably want to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Use the Spark view engine</li>
	<li>Use the WebForms view engine</li>
	<li>Control how your Routes are generated and Url&#8217;s are resolved</li>
	<li>Create Ajax endpoints</li>
	<li>Wring more value out of FubuMVC&#8217;s composable model binding</li>
	<li>Explore the considerable view helper support</li>
	<li>Get you some Html convention awesomeness</li>
	<li>Create custom Wrapper behaviors and apply them</li>
	<li>Composing your application with Partials, Content Extensions, and Bottles</li>
	<li>Use the advanced diagnostics</li>
	<li>Explore the authorization integration</li>
	<li>Learn a little bit about the philosophy and design behind FubuMVC and why it&#8217;s different from other <span class="caps">MVC</span> frameworks (and why this helps you)</li>
	<li>Configure your own FubuRegistry to start setting up your own conventions</li>
	<li>Discover what conventions are available to you</li>
	<li>Adding functionality in a convention and compositional way (harnessing all of FubuMVC&#8217;s power)</li>
	<li>Embrace and extend FubuMVC</li>
</ul>
<p>(these will be turning into links as we get more guides done)</p>
